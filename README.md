# PG_County_Energy_Data_Analysis


The PG Parks and Recreation department is responsible for operating and maintaining
facilities at local and regional parks providing recreational services and programs. This enables
members of the PG community to be engaged, entertained, learn new skills, and feel inclusive
within their community. Their main goal, according to their website, is to “preserve, enhance,
and protect [county’s] open spaces to enrich the quality of life for present and future generations
in a safe and secure environment.” The PG Parks and Recreation department is a very successful
organization that provides quality services, having won six national gold medals for excellence
in the past years.


Providing recreational services requires capital investments into building facilities and
maintaining parks throughout the Prince George’s County area resulting in the use of vast
amounts of energy and resources to accomplish these goals. It is our job to help the department
manage its expenditures and energy usage while still enabling them to fulfill their mission and
commitment to the County. We will accomplish this by analyzing their energy dataset and
providing information driven guidance on the future sustainability of facilities.


Throughout our data analysis and visualization process, we will be referring to the
Energy Use Intensity (EUI) metric, which represents the energy efficiency of a building. EUI is
calculated as the energy output of a building divided by area in square feet of the building. There
are two types of EUI: source and site. Site EUI is the total energy consumption of a building.
Source EUI is the total energy consumption of a building in addition to the energy generated at
the power plants and any losses in the delivery of a building. Another abbreviation that we will
refer to is EPA, Environmental Protection Agency. We will use the agency’s recommended EUI
to compare the energy efficiency of the PG county buildings to the national recommended level.
